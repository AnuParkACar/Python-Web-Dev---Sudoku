documentation for functions:

...
Function name: domain_generator
Description: takes in a "board", with either numerical values or "nil", 
and outputs a dict with values assigned for each sqaure, with "nil" getting
replaced by all of the possible that can be filled in the square
Input: list
Output: dict
Side effects: no direct side effects, could influence every other function 
in the file
...

...
Function name: complete_board_generator
Description: takes in a list comprised of the board as it is being solved, i.e. 
n - # of values already assgined, dicts, and fills in the missing assignments,
i.e. the empty squares, with all possible values, 1...n
Input: list
Output: list
Side effects: modifies the second element of the output of backtracking_search
...

...
Function name: revise
Description: given two variables, var1 and var2 this fucntion ensures that var1
is consistent w/ var 2 by pruning var1's domain if, after checking the constraints
, the value in var1's domain did not appear w/ any combination of var2's domain;
returns true if any value in var1's domain was pruned
Input: string, string, dict, dict
Output: bool
Side effects: prunes value in the domain that is passed in, could influence ac_3(), backtracking_search(),
backtrack(), unassigned_vars(), is_assignment_complete(), check_assignment_var_path(), and
check_unassigned_vars_path()
...

...
Function name: ac_3
Description: maintains arc consistency for every single variable for the given 
domain, returns false if consistency could not be established
Input: dict, dict, 
Output: bool
Side effects: no direct side effect could influence backtracking_search(),
backtrack(), unassigned_vars(), is_assignment_complete(), check_assignment_var_path(), and
check_unassigned_vars_path()
...

...
Function name: create_arcs
Description: helper function for ac_3(), splits up a constraint into its two arcs, 
which are stored in a list that is returned
Input: dict
Output: list
Side effects: adds a constraint's flipped version (second arc) to the constraints dict,
could influence ac_3(), backtracking_search(),
backtrack(), unassigned_vars(), is_assignment_complete(), check_assignment_var_path(), and
check_unassigned_vars_path()

...

...
Function name: minimum_remaining_values()
Description: given a list of vars, returns the var with the smallest domain
Input: list, dict
Output: string
Side effects: no direct side effects, could influence revise(), ac_3(), backtracking_search(),
backtrack(), unassigned_vars(), complete_board_generator(), is_assignment_complete(), check_assignment_var_path(), and
check_unassigned_vars_path() 
...

...
Function name: backtracking_search()
Description: wrapper function for backtrack(), calculates which vars in the init
board have values assgined to them, with these vars being stored in a key value pair
in a dict, with this dict, and two empty lists, for the assigned vars path, to store
the progression of the board, and for the unassigned_vars_path, being returned into the actual
function as the "state space", along with the constraints, and the problem (domain)
Input: dict, dict
Output: backtrack(constraints, domain, statespace)
Side effects: influences the init input of backtrack(), could influence revise(), ac_3(),
backtrack(), unassigned_vars(), complete_board_generator(), is_assignment_complete(), check_assignment_var_path(), and
check_unassigned_vars_path() 
...

...
Function name: unassigned_vars()
Description: given the domain, returns a dict with key,value pairs of all vars
that don't have a definitive value
Input: dict
Output: dict
Side effects: influences backtrack(), unassigned_vars(), and check_unassigned_vars_path()
...

...
Function name: is_assignment_complete()
Description: given a domain, returns true if every var has a definitive value
assigned to it
Input: dict
Output: bool
Side effects: influences backtrack()
...

...
Function name: check_assignment_var_path()
Description: addresses a bug where the assignment_var_path gets improperly populated,
or improperly pruned, returns false if this bug occurs
Input: list
Output: bool
Side effects: influences backtrack(), complete_board_generator()
...

...
Function name: check_unassigned_vars_path()
Description: addresses a bug where the unassigned_vars_path could have an empty list more than once,
returns false the if there are somehow more than one boards that are empty
Input: list
Output: bool
Side effects: influences backtrack()
...

...
Function name: backtract()
Description: uses ac_3 and minimum_remaining_values to go through the values
w/ undefinitve domains, checks if it can find a solution by setting its value to one of its
domain values, does this recursing through with an updated domain, the constraints, and the statespace 
and an update assignments dict, with the given var being added with its value, that is being tested;
this recursion goes on until a solution is found, or if the value being tested results in a failure,
in which case, the function back tracks, takes the value out of the assignments dict,
and tests the next value in the domain of the minimum_remaining_values provided var
Input: dict, dict, list
Output: list
Side effects: influences backtrack(), complete_board_generator; could influence, revise(), ac_3(), unassigned_vars(), complete_board_generator(), is_assignment_complete(), check_assignment_var_path(), and
check_unassigned_vars_path()  
...

...
Function name: reroute()
Description: reroutes the puzzle string to user() but catches the "favicon" string,
Input: string
Output: the url for the user function and the puzzle string, which it is rerouted
to via the reroute() call
Side effects: influences user()
...

...
Function name: user() 
Description: takes in the puzzle string, for which a domain is generated, 
a solution is calculated via a backtracking_search call, and the assignment_var_path
is "completed" 
Input: string
Output: render(.html file, dict, dict, list, list)
Side effects: influencs the input to the html file
